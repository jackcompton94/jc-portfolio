        <p>
            Originally from Baltimore, MD, I spent a significant part of my life writing, performing, and touring North America with Queensway.
            When I wasn't busy with music, I was either gaming or studying Computer Science. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Some of my earliest memories involve developing small games with friends, building dashboards to keep track of game stats, 
            and crafting simple <code>bash</code> scripts to automate random tasks on my first computer that somehow came pre-loaded with Ubuntu. 
            (I still don't know how Mom even managed to do that, but thank you for kickstarting me!)
            Anyway, I still very much love music, but I truly thrive in tech start-ups. Here, I still get 
            to embrace the D.I.Y. mentality <i>and</i> live out my passion for developing, debugging, and engineering software.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Professionally, I use Python to build internal tools, JavaScript to develop web-app components (and bug fixes), and debug/review Java.
            I also <i>live</i> out of tools like Jira and Notion to build out documentation and run daily stand-up meetings to lead my team.
        </p>
